HOSTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM:

  This project is designed to allocate hostel rooms to students based on their CGPA. The program 
reads student data from a file and processes it to determine the highest CGPA students. The 
allocation follows a priority system where students with higher CGPAs are given preference for AC 
rooms. If unavailable, students are placed in the next available room category. If all rooms 
are filled, the remaining students are listed as unallocated.
